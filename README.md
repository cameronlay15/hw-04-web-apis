# hw-04-web-apis

This project we were tasked with completeing a trivia game including a high score and timer. We were manipulating the DOM in order to call files.
# Installation

I pulled the png files from Github from the gt-atl-fsf-ft-08-2020 repo. The remainder of the formatting was from Boot Strap and javaScript including forms, buttons, nav bars, etc. 

# Usage
This is a functional quiz game that can be used for education or entertainment credits.
